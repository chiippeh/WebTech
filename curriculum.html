            <h3>Ode to Curriculum</h3>
            <hr>
            <div id="marks">
                In the hallowed halls of knowledge's keep,
                A curriculum unfolds, in shadows deep.
                Its pages bound in wisdom's tender touch,
                A journey mapped, for minds to clutch.
                
                Upon the canvas of each eager soul,
                The lessons weave, an intricate scroll.
                From letters penned to numbers vast,
                A symphony of learning, unsurpassed.
                
                In ancient tomes and modern lore,
                The curriculum unveils, a treasure store.
                Each chapter tells a tale untold,
                Of heroes brave and stories bold.
                
                From sciences that probe the cosmic sea,
                To arts that set imaginations free,
                The curriculum, a garden wide,
                Where seeds of thought and dreams abide.
                
                In language's dance, both spoken and scribed,
                A world of voices, intertwined.
                From poets' quills to orators' might,
                The power of words takes its flight.
                
                Through numbers' realm, a landscape vast,
                Equations dance, revealing truths amassed.
                From geometry's grace to algebra's might,
                The language of math takes its flight.
                
                In history's grasp, the past unfurls,
                A tapestry of nations, flags unfurled.
                The rise and fall, the triumphs and woe,
                A legacy for all who dare to know.
                
                From laboratories' hum to nature's call,
                The sciences beckon, one and all.
                Through microscopes and telescopic sight,
                We glimpse the secrets, day and night.
                
                The arts, a mirror to the human soul,
                Expressing passions, making us whole.
                With colors vivid, melodies sweet,
                The world of art, a sacred retreat.
                
                In physical realms, we stretch and grow,
                Our bodies strong, our spirits aglow.
                Through movement, sport, and health's embrace,
                A curriculum of wellness takes its place.
                
                So let us honor this sacred creed,
                The curriculum's call, the soul's deep need.
                For in its grasp, we find our way,
                A path to guide us, come what may.
                
                In every heart, its echoes sound,
                A symphony of knowledge, unbound.
                A curriculum, a gift divine,
                To light our way, to make us shine.
